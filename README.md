#swiss army knife i use with ansible and terraform. 
#unlike other repos which forces you to have the exact same lab environment.
#the pieces inside this repo should contain enough information for anyone who wants to automate their vsphere lab
#and at the same time learn the basics of ansible, terraform, packer
#uses ansible for nsxt library, it's terribly broken as a collection right now, you'll have to ansible.cfg and move the modules into your #library for it to work, or you can just look at mine. hey i cloned from others too! :) but i made sure i understood their work.
#Have fun!
